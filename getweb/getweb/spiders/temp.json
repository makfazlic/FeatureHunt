                "cons": "MAS90 was a pre-Windows software that had limits, but was workable.  Then MAS90 was sold and given a facelift to become Sage 100.  Sage 100 is basically a format, presentation and color change from MAS90.  I used MAS90 25 years ago and learned some of the shortcuts after going to the State of the Art University.  When I left the company that used MAS90, within a short time something happened to the business world:  Windows.  Now 25 years later and after several versions and upgrades of Windows, I am once again working with MAS90 behind the mask of SAGE 100.  It is not like revisiting an old friend, but an old motel that are still using the same bedding.  The training that I received did help make the reintroduction easier.  It is ironic that several times in the search bar of Sage 100 it even refers to \"MAS90.\"  None-the-less as noted the Windows rise and dominance came into the mainstream if not becoming the stream of business.  The tough thing is that MAS90 did not change with a Windows feel when it was altered into Sage 100.  Frankly, it is most frustrating to jump from Outlook, Word, Excel then to Sage 100.  Something as easy as hitting \"enter\" or \"tab\" in Sage 100 will cause redundancy in keying and wasted time.  The answer is simple, the user MUST have a passion for selecting or clicking the left mouse button and consciously shifting their thinking from 2019 back to 1994 when ever they enter the world of Sage 100.",

One of my biggest complaints in dealing with Big-Tech ERP (no names to protect the guilty) is how everything gets nickel and dimed after the contract is signed, and money is exchanged. Sure, I'm not the one writing the checks, but I feel for clients in this predicament. Not the case here. ",

Although BizAutomation may be a smaller software company in comparison of size, they certainly were every bit as capable in delivering the same features based on the demos they gave us.  I was very impressed in terms of what they could provide us vs the larger software vendors.  I\u2019m sure those companies offer some features that BizAutomation, but BizAutomation offered features that the competition couldn't.  BizAutomation met every need we asked of it for a significantly smaller cost, and the customer service is second to none.  Very impressed with their product and their service!",

If I were being nitpicky, I might would say that we had some performance slowness one day for a few hours, but those were resolved quickly and we never had another instance of that.  I asked and was told that this is something they monitor and when hardware gets saturated they upgrade which makes sense.",

In hindsight that was due to a sales person knowing they were leaving {they left}, but the company made good on their initial items.  The implementation team did not address properly our 4 items that were critical for our needs.  Approx 12 months later our business analyst wrote up a quick 2 to 4 page document for them and reshared documents we provided their staff in the first couple of months of the project.    It appears that \"yes\" was the answer to can we do it.  However they did not vet that \"yes\" properly.   Their service overall was fine, main person kept pushing off the key items for \"later\" which is normally a red flag.  They asked if we would go live without those items and we declined for a # of reasons.    Later they asked if we would consider paying some additional cost to achieve them; we initially said no; then said we would if this would finalize it. {They set the offer on that}.   The Virus then hit; and was then told that we might need 10x's that initial offer they set.  We obviously said that is not reasonable.    For us the jury is still out on whether or not they will make good.   Their system appears to be good for all the basic accounting items; it is a bit large to configure but base system is good.   At this point the ball is in their court to finalize what was promised.  We are optimistic that they will do that.  The needs we have are industry specific not our company.  TBD",

We can't finalize the final con's til this is done but we will post again then.    We believe they will step up, it is trying times but everyone is in this together. ",

I have used the product since 2003, and have watched it evolve from a simple tool to a more sophisticated application. The company has been receptive to user requests such as increasing the size of database fields to allow larger numbers, adding supplementary schedules, and direct cash flow projections.    Some of the debt amortization wizards are very handy, providing current portion of LTD in addition to amortizing loan balances and interest charges.     They have also included some valuation and ratio analysis work papers that are very handy.    This is a small company (at least it operates as one) where you can actually talk to a real live person.    All in all, it is a very good application for the price.",
                "cons": "The application occasionally will show some instability, but this has been vastly improved over earlier versions. There are recovery routines so most of the data is not lost. The crashes seem mostly due to print driver compatabilities. The developers are pretty good at fixing these issues.    Large, complicated formulas may run into size limits when calculating dollar outcomes. When this occurs, I have created interim formulas in a workbook to get to the final formula.    It's nice that the application has supplementary schedules for the P&L. However there are no such supporting schedules for the balance sheet. Much of the work I do is in the balance sheet. It would nice to have a supporting schedule that would clean up the balance sheet presentation.    The learning curve can be a little steep for the novice user.

Not even copy and paste is possible.  2.- Make it more friendly. PG can only be mastered by someone with a strong background in Finance  3.- Expand reporting capabilities and allow to export reports to excel with up the 36 months instead of only 12 mo.  4.- Develop a Mac version or a web version  5.- Develop Inventory module and allow for supporting schedule on the Balance sheet  6.- Flexibility in putting some values ( ie. interest expense) in the balance sheet for capitalization purposes",

The recent stress test on this tool has been given by our latest M&A operations, in which we had to consolidated many companies with lots of intercompany relationships between them and within our Group perimeter. Tagetik let us manage this transition easily and in a short time lapse. With an appropriate configuration of the environment these new incorporations did not require additional resources (in terms of time and people). The absence of information duplicates and the use of an automated data entry platform allowed us to manage the communication with our new contributors in an efficient and effective way. In this process it is worth mentioning the contribution of the Tagetik consulting team that has supported us with prompt interventions on our main technical issues.",

Use the program to track assets, especially if there's LOTS of assets. Forget using spreadsheets where many people just use the straight line depreciation and must calculate it MANUALLY which kills the efficiency and relative accuracy since you may mess up the depreciation/amortization if one does NOT pay attention to calculate them properly. Penny wise, pound foolish!! It's best used either for financial reporting (tax/book differences, if any) and Better if used with the related tax software as it NEEDS to be updated YEARLY for EACH tax year's program or else it will NOT 'link'! You can categorize the assets to be each for internal reporting (i.e. in QBs) but it MUST be done ANNUALLY so the records match one another.   ",

Many [OLDer] accountants refuse to update their clients' fixed assets then complain about it and Still do NOT fix them! Must buy YEARLY to match tax software for 'link' to work!",
